# Train

I've now created my dataset so I'm going to try start finetuning. I'm sure I'll be going back to the data stage before long but hopefully I shall be more informed.

I'm going to use the [axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) library because it looks pretty neat and has some simple examples that I can modify for my usecase.
