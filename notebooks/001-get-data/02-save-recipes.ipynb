      "1. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until paste is slightly darkened in color (it should start to fry in the oil), about 1 minute. Add tomato purée, salt, and sugar, and bring to a simmer. Partially cover pot with a lid (to avoid splattering), reduce heat so sauce is at a very bare simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 40–50 minutes. Do ahead: Sauce can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool. Transfer to an airtight container; cover and chill.\n",
      "2. Working one at a time, place a chicken breast on a cutting board so a short side is towards you and holding a chef’s knife parallel to breast, slice along the middle of a long side to make a slit. Continue to slice until you are about ½\" from the other side. Open breast up like a book and place between 2 sheets of wax paper or plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet or a rolling pin, pound until ⅓\" thick (not making it super thin will keep it from overcooking).\n",
      "3. Combine garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil in a large baking dish. Season chicken cutlets all over with salt (about ¾ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt per cutlet). Add to marinade and turn to coat. Let sit at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour. (The lemon juice will turn the flesh opaque, but that’s nothing to worry about.)\n",
      "4. Make a dredging station: Whisk eggs, garlic powder, onion powder, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt, and 2 Tbsp. water in a large shallow bowl (cake pans or pie plates work great). Place panko in another large shallow bowl and flour in a third. Whisk remaining 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt into flour.\n",
      "5. Working with 1 cutlet at a time and letting any excess marinade drip back into baking dish, dredge cutlets in flour, knocking off excess, then dip into egg wash, letting excess drip back into bowl. Dredge in panko, pressing firmly to adhere, ensuring no bare spots remain. Gently shake off excess and place cutlets on a rimmed baking sheet. Chill at least 20 minutes and up to 8 hours.\n",
      "6. Set a wire rack inside a second large rimmed baking sheet. Grate mozzarella on the large holes of a box grater into a medium bowl; add Parmesan and toss to combine.\n",
      "7. Pour vegetable oil into a large high-sided heavy skillet to come 1\" up sides. Heat over medium until an instant-read thermometer registers 400°. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan and returning oil to 400° after each batch, very carefully lower cutlets into skillet with tongs and cook until deep golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer cutlets to prepared rack; season with salt.\n",
      "8. Heat broiler. Arrange cutlets side by side in 2 large baking dishes or separately in 4 smaller baking dishes. Generously spoon some sauce over each cutlet (you want to mostly cover them but allow some corners and edges to remain uncovered). Spoon remaining sauce into baking dishes around the cutlets. Cover cutlets with cheese mixture (again, leaving some of those crispy edges uncovered). Broil until cheese is melted, bubbling, and browned in spots, about 4 minutes. Remove chicken from broiler. Let cool slightly and sprinkle with parsley.\n",

      "1. Toast the shrimp and make the sauce: Heat a small dry pan or wok over medium heat, add the dried shrimp, and cook, stirring frequently, until they’re dry all the way through and slightly crispy, about 5 minutes. Set them aside in a small bowl. Covered at room temperature, they’ll keep for up to 1 week.\n",
      "2. Combine the tamarind water, simple syrup, and fish sauce in a small bowl and stir well. Measure 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons, discarding the rest.\n",
      "3. Soak the noodles and stir-fry the dish: Soak the noodles in lukewarm water until they’re very pliable but not fully soft, about 20 minutes. Drain them well and snip them into approximately 8-inch lengths just before stir-frying.\n",
      "4. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat (or a wok over very high heat), add the pork fat, and swirl it to coat the sides. When it begins to smoke lightly, crack the egg into the center of the pan (it should spit and sizzle violently and the whites should bubble and puff). Add the tofu, radish, and dried shrimp beside the egg. If you’re using a skillet, decrease the heat to medium; if you’re using a wok, keep the heat very high.\n",
      "5. Cook, stirring everything but the egg, until the edges of the egg are light golden brown, about 1 minute, then flip the egg (it’s fine if the yolk breaks), break the egg into several pieces with the spatula, and stir everything together well.\n",
      "6. Add the noodles and bean sprouts, and stir-fry (constantly stirring, scooping, and flipping) until the noodles and bean sprouts have softened slightly, about 1 minute.\n",
      "7. Add the shrimp, then stir the tamarind mixture once more and add it to the pan. Stir-fry, making sure the shrimp get plenty of time on the hot surface, until they are cooked through, just about all the liquid has evaporated, and the noodles are fully tender and no longer look gloppy or clumpy, 2 to 4 minutes.\n",
      "8. Add the chives and 1 tablespoon of the peanuts. Stir-fry briefly, then transfer it all to a plate, sprinkle on the remaining peanuts and chives, and serve with the lime wedges. Season to taste with the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar-soaked chiles, and chile powder.\n",
      "9. Note: Semi-dried noodles (fairly pliable rather than brittle, like fully dried) are widely available in the refrigerated sections of Asian markets. If you can’t find semi-dried noodles, you can substitute 2 1/4 ounces of fully dried “phat thai” noodles soaked in lukewarm water for about 10 extra minutes (to approximate the texture of semi-dried noodles).\n",

      "4. Still on low speed, mix in the chocolate chips and the hazelnut (or almond) flour. Refrigerate dough for 2 hours or up to 3 days. If you are planning to freeze a portion - you can scoop out 1 1/2-inch rounds of dough to freeze.\n",
      "5. Preheat oven to 350F with rack centered. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop out 1 1/2\" rounds of dough onto baking sheet, about 2-inches apart.\n",
      "6. Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 8 minutes, and then, using a spatula, gently press each mound down just a little; rotate the baking sheet when returning to oven. Bake for another 7 minutes, or so, until the cookies are pale brown. They'll still be slightly soft in the center, but that's fine- they'll firm up as they cool. Transfer to rack to cool. Repeat with remainder of dough, always using a cool baking sheet.\n",

      "4. In the same skillet that you browned you beef in (do not rinse), add in the diced onion. Let the onions become translucent then add in the cooking wine in order to get off anything that might be sticking to the pan. Stir it around a bit and then add all of the contents of the skillet into the slow cooker.\n",
      "5. Add the tomato paste, rosemary, thyme, and bay leaf into the slow cooker. Season with salt and pepper as preferred.

      "\n",
      "Ingredients\n",
      "\n",
      "100g/3½oz porridge oats\n",
      "50g/1¾oz pecan nuts, roughly chopped\n",
      "1 tsp baking powder\n",
      "pinch sea salt\n",
      "1 ripe banana, peeled and mashed\n",
      "150ml/5fl oz coconut milk or almond milk\n",
      "2 tsp coconut oil, for frying\n",
      "200g/7oz blueberries\n",
      "100g/3½oz blueberries\n",
      "3 tbsp caster sugar\n",
      "2 bananas, peeled and cut into thin slices\n",
      "a few pecan nuts, finely chopped\n",
      "1 lime, cut into wedges\n",
      "8 tbsp maple syrup (optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "Method\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 120C/100C Fan/Gas ½.\n",
      "2. In a food processor, pulse the oats until you have a scruffy flour. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the pecans, baking powder and salt.\n",
      "3. In a separate bowl, mix the mashed banana with the milk (you can do this in the food processor, if you like). Beat the banana mixture into the dry ingredients and leave the batter to sit for a few minutes.\n",
      "4. For the blueberry compôte, put the blueberries and sugar in a small pan with a teaspoon of water and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until you have a thick shiny compôte. Set aside until ready to serve.\n",
      "5. Heat a non-stick pan over a medium heat. Add the banana slices and fry on both sides in the dry pan until golden-brown and caramelised. Keep warm in the oven.\n",
      "6. Put the pan back on the heat and add a little coconut oil or butter. Drop in a generous tablespoon of batter for each pancake. Once the sides are cooked and bubbles have risen to the top, scatter over a handful of blueberries and flip the pancake over. Cook for another couple of minutes on the other side, or until lightly coloured. (The pancakes will stay a little moist in the middle because of the banana, so don’t worry.) Keep them warm in the oven while you cook the remaining pancakes.\n",
      "7. Serve the pancakes in a stack with the banana slices. Add some chopped pecans and a squeeze of lime, and, if you like, with a drizzle of maple syrup. Serve the compôte on the side.\n",
