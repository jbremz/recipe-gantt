    "Now I need to add the instruction column. I'm really interested in training a model that can map directly from recipe to gantt chart, without the painful CoT prompting that I had to do with GPT4. That way it should be quicker and maybe less prone to differences in formatting etc?\n",

    "I think this leaves me with two options:\n",
    "1. Write a short prompt for the instruction column explaining the desired output similar to the GPT4 prompt but importantly _without_ the CoT.\n",
    "    - This might give the model somewhere to start from (important with such a small dataset)\n",
    "    - However, it seems a bit strange/redundant to be giving the same instruction in every example. This information would be redundant and would increase computational overhead.\n",
    "1. Put the input into the instruction column and provide no input.\n",
    "    - The model _should_ simply treat the instructions similarly to the input (the only difference is where they appear in the prompt)\n",
    "    - The task _should_ be implicitly learnable from the input and output pairs\n",
    "    - This option should have a smaller computational overhead\n",
    "    - I'd just be worried that it might be a bit too much to ask the model to infer the structure of the task when I have such a small training set\n",
