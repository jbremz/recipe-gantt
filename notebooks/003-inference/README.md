# Inference

Now I have a model finetuned that seems to work ok, I'm going to work on an inference pipeline.

First, it'd make sense to run this on GPU, but eventually it'd be cool to get it running locally on my macbook for real life recipe bizness.

I'm not that excited about making it look beautiful because that's not my area of expertise. Hopefully this will suffice as an ok POC.
